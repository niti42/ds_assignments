["\n\n  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.\n\n", "\n\n  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look\n\n", "\n\n  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range.\n\n", "\n\n  If I started to rating it's all features, it will as followed (Out of 5 üåü):Processor ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êDisplay ‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êBattery ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSound in loud ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSound in 3.5 mm cord ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCamera Selfie ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCamera Back ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êNetworking ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êLack:There is no Fingers print sensor locked.There is no Back cover in the box.Camera quality not so good.\n\n", '\n\n  Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!\n\n', "\n\n  Worst phone.. overall performance is just bakwaz....don't buy...always hangs\n\n", '\n\n  I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery.\n\n', '\n\n  Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other\n\n']
